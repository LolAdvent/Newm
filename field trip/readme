## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

for this field trip project i would want it to be about the clothing and accessorys that the natives have worn.

### Core Webpages


for my webpages i would include a clothing page which would deswcribe the clothing used by tribes and some importantance of special clothing based on position in the tribe. 
another page describing accesory and who would wear it and when

i would have pictures showing the clothings that the user could hover over and it would tell the user a short description of the clothes and who would wear em. same would be said with the accesory

### Design Choices



for the color scheme i would do what everyone thinks history would be colored, so a goldish brown color.

main insprition comes from a site i cant remember since i it was a assigment back in middle school. its had a scroll in which images would appear and disappear and have text to the side of them.

i would like to structure my site.

the images would be on the larger side and would like the text to be a round border that would appear on one of the sides.

maybe have a transprant image in the background
